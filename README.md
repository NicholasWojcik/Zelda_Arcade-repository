# Zelda Arcade Game

## About
> This is my favorite project, as I enjoy graphics and this was my first dive into it.  It is a simple arcade
style game where the user runs from enemies and tries to survive as they increase.  My favorite part of this
project was getting the enemies to move towards the player while staying in bounds.

## To-do
> The project is complete on the outside.  However, the code needs much more organization.  As I learn more 
I plan on organizing the images and packages within this project.
